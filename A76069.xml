            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:137180:5"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> am not put upon either by force or indigencie, nor by a vain-glorie, or ſelf-end to ſet down any letter; and to leave it to poſterity; onely a meer conſideration of the frailty &amp;, of the miſerableneſs of this world where the Children of darkneſſe are almoſt quite loſt in their groaping wayes, hath cauſed me to do ſo. I am not able to expreſſe how much my minde is perplexed, when I think on the folly of this frail world, and conſider the Cymmerian darkneſſe of its Children, which think themſelves of deep underſtanding, when they have heard ſome fopperies of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Chair-men diſcourſed of, thereby ſuppoſing to be much enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their underſtandings. Where is that high and precious Medicine of the ancient Philoſophers, which lived before any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity was talk'd, or heard of, who received their Revelations upon an earneſt pious prayer unto God, joyning thereunto their dayly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into natural things, and laying their hands to the work. Whither I ſay, is fled their painfulneſſe and induſtry? Surely to no other place, than to the horrid, impure, and ſordid Apothecaries ſhops, deeply precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and buried in the earth, and ſunk ſo deep, that the ringing nor ſounding of bells, and beating of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are able to rouſe it: thus their praiſe and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the highest is at a ſtand! and who produceth any good of it? Thus much am I perſwaded, that if my writings ſhall be produced to light after my death, and the judicious posteritie, the Apoſtles and Diſciples of them do rightly read, meditate, nnd underſtand them well, and do out of a Chriſtian intention ſeek, dive,
<pb facs="tcp:137180:6"/> and work the ſame onely to the glorie of God, and the love and charity of their fellow brethren and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than by means of their actions and works, that depend, from ſuch good and proper fundamentals, will be diſcovered and laid open to the publick view, all thoſe fopperies and forgeries, which theſe great mouth'd vain-glorious fellows, and high conceited fools, which proclaim themſelves to be the ſole Phyſicians and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of both Medicines, that is of the inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and arrogate to themſelves great dignities and worths in the world, when there is no cauſe for it. Their intentions are ſet upon no other foundations, but to live in great respect, to haunt after vain-glorie with a ſear'd conſcience, to deprive their fellow Chriſtians of their monies by cheating, all they look for, is to be talk'd of, and live in reputation; they ſtick full of diabolical pride and vanity up to the ears, theſe in the end, in great woe and miſerie have their poor Souls drowned moſt lamentably! woe, woe, to you Children of Sathan! Here I intend not to uſe any prolixity of words, nor to bring in any ſuch matters, which are heterogeneal to my purpoſe; at the cloſing of my book I will be more large in my expreſſions, as far as the heavenly Prince ſhall enable me to do, where, as for a final Corollarie to all my writings, I ſhall annex things with that proviſo and intreaty, that all thoſe, which intend to be real, and conſcionable in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, may aide &amp; cure their oppreſſed fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to ſearch and inquire into ſuch things, which God for ſuch purpoſes hath ordained, and implanted them into nature.</p>

                  <p>This preſent book of mine deſerves to be called [A light unto darkneſſe] for other things, which in my former writings I have diſcourſed of by way of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which ſtile I made uſe of the rather, becauſe it is proper to Philoſophers, are declared in this my laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, where I deal in plain and clear words, deſcribing, and naming the matter openly, ſhewing the preparations from the beginning, to the middle and end, demonſtrating, and ſetting before the eyes of men the matter in <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> confirming, and juſtifying the truth thereof, and making a diſtinction betwixt the ground and no ground, in ſo plain terms, that the very Children may underſtand, and feel it with their hands. And becauſe this book affordeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other knowledge, differing from others of my writing, wherein I have not written ſo obſcurely, nor made I uſe of ſuch ſubtilties, as the ancients did, who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and ended their dayes happily, therefore doth it require another place alſo to be laid up in, and kept ſecret from the perverſeneſſe of men in the world. I do not deſire it ſhould be buried with me, to be a prey, and food for Worms, but it ſhall be left above ground, and kept ſecret, from wicked men, and my purpoſe is, that it ſhall be laid into a ſecret place, where none ſhall come near it, but he, for whom God hath ordained it, other writings of mine ſhall ſooner ſee the publick light.</p>
                  <p>But know thou, whoever thou art, into whoſe hand this my laſt Teſtament comes, which contains the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of heavenly and earthly myſteries, it will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:137180:7"/> to thee by a divine providence, to whoſe cuſtody, at my devotion then perform'd, I committed it, depoſiting the ſame into that ſecret place together with other things, not inforced upon any grounds of neceſsities, or ſtraightneſſes, to leave it there, onely for him, whom Gods goodneſſe ſhall appoint to finde it. For it is not good for me to let God's Creatures and myſterie, which are too abſtruſe already, and ſtept from the light into darkneſſe, by reaſon of the malicious perverſeneſſe of the wicked world to die with me, as envious men are with to do with gifts, they are entrusted withall; but even leave a glimpſe of truth and of the clear heaven, thinking befitting to diſcharge my conſcience in putting forth the talent to uſury, let the will of the Lord be done in him, whom he deemeth to be worthy of it, into whoſe care and diligence I commit it from henceforth and for ever. For I a Cloyſter-man, and an unworthy Servant of the Divine infinite Trinitie confeſſe, and ackowledge, that I ſhould never have come ſo far in my knowledge of theſe endleſſe myſteries, in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of natural things, in the melioration, &amp; changing their qualities, for a ſure and ſtrong upholding of this profound knowledge of the true Medicine, according to this Ordinance (whereby I am ready to do good to all and every one, which deſireth my help herein) which as I have done hitherto, ſo my deſire is that God would enable me to do the ſame to the laſt of my breathing I ſay I ſhould never have attained unto it, if by God ſpecial goodneſſe, grace, and mercie, ſeveral books had not come into my hands, written of ancient Maſters
<pb facs="tcp:137180:7"/> which departed this life a long time before me, cauſing great joy to me, ſtirring up in me a return of hearty thanks to God, who ſo graciouſly was pleaſed in his providence to beſtow them on me in the Cloyſter before any of my Fellows.</p>
                  <p>I do ſpeak it without any vain-glorie, I have done ſo much good thereby to my fellow-Chriſtians, as ever was poſſible for me to do, which next to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thanks for it, even to the end of my dayes.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas I can be Steward no longer, I have done according as my abilities would give leave: let others alſo be induſtrious, and not defective in their Stewardſhip. I return mine into the faithfull hands of God Almighty, and deliver up to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and glorie, inſtead of the Keyes for the houſe, all the allotted myſteries ſet down here in my writing; leaving them to his dispoſing, to bestow them after my death unto him, whom his Divine will ſhall chuſe thereunto, to be for the knowledge of his praiſe-worthy name, the good and help of ſuch, that ſtand in want of neceſſaries and health, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding and ſhunning of all worldly pompe, pride, wantonneſſe, luxurie, raſhneſſe, pleaſure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and ſpightfulneſſe, or contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>O Lord God Almighty, mercifull, Gracious Father of thine onely begotten Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who art onely the Lord of <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> the principle of all things that are made by thy Word, and definite end of all

Lord, to thee alone belongs power, might, and glorie, to thee is the praiſe, honour, and gratefulneſſe, for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and graces thou haſt beſtowed on me, and haſt preſerved me therein till to this my great age, and loweſt weakneſſe. O! thou God of all graces, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all comforts, be not angrie with me, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up to thee, mine eternal Creator, the Keyes of my Stewardſhip, wrapt up in this Pergamene, according to the dutie, my calling and conſcience calls for: with theſe thou ſuffer'ſt me to keep houſe the moſt of my time, till now, thou haſt called, and foreſeen me to be thy ſervant and Steward, and haſt graciouſly afforded, that I ſhould enjoy the noble ſweet fruits, which were gathered in thy Almonarie to my laſt inſtant end, which now, O Lord, lieth in thy power. I beſeech thee
<pb facs="tcp:137180:8"/> for the dear merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> come now, whe thou pleaſeſt, incloſe my heart, receive my Soul into thy heavenly Throne of grace, let her be recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thee graciouſly, O thou faithfull God, who haſt redeemed her on the holy Croſſe with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tincture of the true bloud of thy holy bodie: then is my life well ended on this earth, grant to the bodie a quiet reſt, till at the laſt day, bodie and ſoul joyn again, and are of a heavenly compoſition: for now my onely deſire is to be diſſolved, and to be with my Lord Christ, The which thou Almighty, Holy, and Heavenly Trinitie grant to me, and all good Chriſtian believers. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I may come to the work intended, and make a beginning of the work in hand, if God be pleaſed to let this book come to thy hands, before all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly you return heartie, and unfeigned thanks for it: in the next place I beſeech him to beſtow on thee alſo grace and bleſſing, a healthfull bodie, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to accompliſh all the points ſet down here, which tend to the well-fare and benefit of thy Neighbour, and to prepare them according to the Manuals, which to that end I ſet down, and preſcribe them, that you may happily and ſuccesfully begin the work, that the middle and end be correspondent thereunto. Then be not flap-tong'd, and reſolve abſolutely in thy he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:137180:9"/> and grant the ſame by other means and wayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee. Therefore look to it, tempt not the Lord thy God, for he will not be mock'd. Be ſilent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving; be meditating on Gods puniſhment, which no your is able to out-run; keep a good intention; let not man greedie minde run on how you may get abundance of Gold and Silver riches, and vanitie, but before all things, which are written herein, let that be your chi feſt aim, how you may appear helpfull in word and deed to promote the health of thy Neighbour Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: Then have you given, and brought an offering of thanks and God will beſtow more upon thee, and with ſuch Revelations will come to thee, more than ever you would have believed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore inſtead of a perfect Phyſick book I have annexed at the end thoſe precious Medicines; with which even to this hour, I have cured ſuccesfully many d fficult Symptomes, and diſeaſes, held by others to be incurable: which I recommend unto thee with the reſt of the things contained in theſe writings, to thy conſcience to be warie, and not to abuſe any of them, as much as thy life and Soul is near and dear unto thee.</p>
                  <p>If thou receiveſt this faithfull admonition and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ning, which I give unto thee here and there at the beginning, middle, and end, and in other places alſo, and doeſt accordingly, then thou canſt not be too thankfull for theſe things, which through Gods permiſſion ſhall be intimated and made known to thee out of this book</p>
                  <p>But in caſe thou wilt ſtrive againſt my faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:137180:9"/> warning and fatherly admonition, theſe myſteries, which were hid from the learned, and thou ſufferſt to come into ſtrange hands! look to thy ſelf, blame not me, think not that there is any reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thee, being cut off from all thoſe, which live and die in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus I let it reſt, committing execution to the Highest, which dwelleth in Heaven, who puniſheth and avengeth all manner of ſins, vices, iniquities, and covenant-breakings. Whereas I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie thus to deſcribe this my Declaration before my other Writings, and to prove the ſame with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that every one, whom God ſhall judge to be worthie of, may conceive, underſtand, and fathom the true beginning, the true middle, and the true end of all created things. Thereupon I purpoſed to make a beginning of it with a neceſſary relation of the Original, beginning, and exiſtencie of Minerals and Metals, from which ariſeth this moſt noble and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Medicine, whereby is procured a healthfull long life, and abundance of riches are obtained: Namely from whence Minerals and Metals have their original, how they be brought to light, that ſearchers into Natural things may know the whole Nature in her circumference, before ever they lay hand to the work, and acquaint themſelves well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: then ſtill the one will ſtream and run forth the other, one Art will produce the other; at laſt all what is ſought for, will be overtaken in joy, and that which hath been long'd for, will happily be enjoyed.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ſeed of Metals.</head>
                     <p>ALl thoſe Authors which have written about the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline ſeed, agree in that, when they ſay ſulphur is the maſculine ſeed of metals, and Mercurie is the foeminine ſeed; which ſaying muſt be taken in its genuine ſenſe; for common Sulphur and common Mercury are not meant thereby. For the viſible Mercury of Metals is a body it ſelf out of bodies, and ſo it cannot be a ſeed: and being cold, its coldneſſe <hi>per ſe</hi> cannot be a ſeed, and the Sulphur of metals being a food, how can it be a ſeed? Yea, a ſeed conſummeth ſulphur, how can one ſeed deſtroy the other? if ſo, what body ſhould it produce? It is therefore an error, if that ſhould be taken in the common ſenſe: if the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of bodies is in a work, and hath taken food, then all the ſex Mercuries protrude one body, as the one of the ſex is in its predominancy, ſo the body riſeth.</p>
                     <p>Seeing there are ſeven of theſe Mercuries, it happeneth, that when the ſeed of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> hath the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie, they produce a maſculine body of <hi>Sol,</hi> but if the ſeed of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth predominate, then is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſoeminine body, which is called <hi>Lune; Mercury</hi> is an aſſiſtant on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>The ſame happeneth unto other bodies: but theſe are alwayes and in every and each work together; for they are indiviſible, as it is meet alſo, what manner of body could be produced elſe? For Nature hath perfect bodyes, though in themſelves they muſt be diſſolved again, yet are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for, &amp; in their time. For what manner of ſeed could that be, if it ſhould be defective in any of its branches?</p>
                     <p>Therefore every body hath its perfect ſeed, hence the traſmutation hath its ground in the <hi>aſcention</hi> and <hi>deſcenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For if any man ſaith, that ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not gold, clowns beleeve that alſo, becauſe they have not fundamental knowledge of the ſeed, how it is to go out of one body into the other, or elſe it wants its fertilitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be naturally without a body, wherein it reſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſubterranean <hi>fuligo</hi> or ſeed, (fume) All theſe are the materials of the body; and as earth is mans matter, out of which God made him, unto which he muſt returne again: ſo all other bodyes alſo at laſt return to earth, that Myner which is judicious and knowing herein, him I judge to deſerve the name of a Miner. For there are but few of them which are rightly informed herein, or hath any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge of it, though they are dayly imployed about it: though ſome might ſay, they could not but bee knowing in their profeſſion, yet it is not ſo really; if ſo, what right uſe can they make of them? They put wrong names upon them, are ignorant of their utility, and this is the reaſon why they many times run them waſte upon heaps, where after ſome time they turne to goodneſſe, and the longer they lye there, the better they are: this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deſerves no hatred, but rather a gratefull aknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Then comes the Alchymiſt, reduceth the body into cinders, calxes, glaſſes, colours, fumes ſubterranean, in which the ſeed of metals reſteth, and the <hi>Ferch</hi> or life is found fertile in the body, and is reducible into a ſpiritual water or <hi>prima materia,</hi> according as the quality and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the metall is, and is divided artificially into its natural principles, according to the proceſſe of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick art, of which more in another place ſhall be ſpoken, when I ſhall treat of the Minerals.</p>

                     <p>THe work of metals evidenceth a perpetual going in, and coming out; for hereby the Egreſſion is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not only the Egreſſion of the whole work, that in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:137180:19"/> ſome place a whole metaline tract comes into decay, when it wants food to be nouriſhed any further, &amp; hath devoured all its bodies, but alſo a partial egreſſion; for ſtill the one ſeeketh he other, and follows at the heel. This we ſee by the mercury of metals, being poured forth, it is ſcattered into thouſands of little quick corns, all of them return to their body; in the ſame condition is <hi>volatile &amp; Lubricum;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ferch</hi> alſo goeth forth in ſmall bits, at laſt it joyneth in a body ſomewhere, even as Bees met together: it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no more than it hath need, the overplus ſwarmeth to another Myne-officine, which parting and diſtributing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords many and ſeveral Mine-works, according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the officine and nouriſhment, and according as it is infringed in its work in the egreſſion; the <hi>Ferch</hi> and the ſeed go on in their <hi>volatilitie,</hi> &amp; if they had wings, that <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi> is ſo thin, that it can hardly be diſcerned, yet is it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated like a heap of atoms; thus ſubtilly it flyeth away, &amp; the <hi>Ferch</hi> muſt ſtill have its <hi>ſeed,</hi> the ſeed its <hi>body,</hi> and that its thin <hi>atoms.</hi> My meaning is not, that its egreſſion is from or out of the earth into the ayre, to fly about there and then to come into ground again; which is not ſo, nor can it be, becauſe its natural work is not in the ayre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men bring it forth purpoſely, then is it of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; of that egreſſion I do not ſpeak here, becauſe it is done by day; but this goeth through the earth. Which ſtands in the furnace, not apprehenſive or viſible to us, and runs through clefts and paſſages; For if the earth giveth way to the ingreſſion and egreſſion, even as the water doth to fiſhes, and the ayre to birds, as long as metals come to their ſtone-firmament, which ſtone firmamet differs from the earth-firmament, when it meets with that, it goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, looking out for another paſſage, like as water that floweth about a ſtone and not through it, yet it ſtayeth in its own ſtone, and receiveth ſtrength of it, &amp; turnes there to a body: and as it goeth in its egreſſion from one meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line firmament or ſtone-firmament to another, if thorow eaten or ſoaked, be it at what diſtance it will, and atract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:137180:19"/> the <hi>Lubicrum,</hi> even as a bird draws its feet up to its body in its flight; for if they touch any where, then they looſe ſomewhat of the body, and the <hi>Lubricum</hi> in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion ſuffers it to come again to a ſtrength of operation: for when both are joyned, then the metal increaſeth, and attracteth its food in a wonderfull way and nouriſheth it ſelfe; and it is to be admired, that in this ingreſſion, when that <hi>Lubricum</hi> comes more and more to its officine, how it increaſeth and ſtrengtheneth it ſelfe ſo long, that at laſt the work is made firme in the officine. This ſtrengthening can not be learned to be any other, than the metaline mercurie doth make it, for in the firſt place it turns it there into a <hi>liquidum,</hi> where afterward it receiveth all, doth coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and congele, according as the bodyes are either <hi>maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine</hi> or <hi>foeminine,</hi> at laſt it is brought to a ſolid fixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Sol.</hi> This ingreſſion makes that ſubterranean place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is a manuduction unto the whole after-work, how the ſame ought to be proceeded in, that the ore may ſtand and not awaken, but turne to its ſtreame, and ſtill abide in its bodies companie, it is loath to make an egreſſion, if once it made a true ingreſſion, and ſetled it ſelfe to the work; for it reſteth not in its place, neither doth it reſt in its whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eparating hath been invented, at which ſome good things of the oars do ſtay, the reſt flieth away, and their fining is uſeful, eſpecially when oars or metals are in their aſcenſion, though it be chargeable. But to find <hi>Electrums,</hi> and bring them to good by ſeperating, differs from the former fining, and requireth a ſingular way of melting. Cunning and ſubtile Artiſts may pretend to get ſilver out of iron, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they may, if there be any in it) as they do in <hi>Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Oſemund</hi> alwayes containeth ſilver, which is onely off driven, and calcine away the iron, and thus they cheat people: can they do the like with the iron which breaks in <hi>Styria?</hi> no ſuch matter. Therefore take heed of ſuch cheaters, and take notice that nature loveth to keep her own wayes orderly, and keeps together two and ſometimes three ſorts of oars in their aſcenſion and deſcenſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe intimateth a way unto the After-work; but men in their fancy think upon other means, though to no purpoſe.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:137180:30"/> View all the Mines which are in <hi>Europe,</hi> you will finde no other oars but impure ones, that is, a mixture of them, for their nature maketh them, as much as I ever could learn; if you can ſhew me the contrary, I will aſſent unto thee, And this is the ſecond Argument, that metals are in their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion and deſcenſion unto perfectneſſe: if each had its peculiar work and inſtrument, then men needed not to take ſo much pains in melting, to ſeparate them. For it is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult work to joyn weeds and ſtones, becauſe theſe are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal, and are of differing ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, take notice of the Flux, to drive the cold fire with the warm, and the warm with the cold, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> you will be able to ſeparate the bodies from <hi>Mercuries,</hi> then you have already ſeparated the metals without loſſe and damage, uſe thy ſelf exactly to it, and be careful in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their names, not regarding the Miners expreſſions and terms, for the names they give to oars are falſe: for thoſe, which build and dig after clefts and paſſages, have their names of their bodily matters after the ſorts of the minerals, and are diſtinct therein. But you muſt call them after the ſorts of the ſeven bodies, and learn to prepare them; this work is of greater utility. Men are at great expences to get corroſive waters, to get aſunder theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, they do it alſo by way of melting and caſting; but ſuch waters add great poiſon to the work; it is a better way to do it with <hi>Lixiviums</hi> or ſharp waters, which are not ſo poiſonous, learn their preparation. There is another kind of impure oar, of which I made mention here and there, which contain Myne-ſlacks, you may read of in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Cinders, but there is a difference betwixt the cinder and the ſlack, for ſlack are more corny, yet that alſo turns at

But how theſe ſubterranean decreaſes are diſcerned, which like crums of bread ſhould be preſerved, Nature being provident keeps them together alſo, bringing them unto the day light, that they might be brought to good, and that metal is known alſo to be under that ground by the <hi>Scobs</hi> or alkali which it excerneth, namely, the rocks, ſtones, flints, which ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature drie in her work, theſe are the offals, if empty of metals, and if ſome good oar be in it then that may well be called <hi>Schlich</hi> or ſliding, becauſe it ſlideth away from the work, it ſtealeth away, where ſuch ſliding is, take notice of it, for it breaks off from the matter in the <hi>officina,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in metals are in their work, and perform their office, and that <hi>Schlich</hi> or ſliding is a ſure ſigne that metals are in that place.</p>
                     <p>So the <hi>Lixivium</hi> alſo, or metalline water is a ſure fore-runner of metals, and it diſſolveth ſtill in the work, and looſeneth ſomewhat from the metals, in which there is a <hi>Schnede</hi> and vertue: for as I have ſaid, when I made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minerals, where there are <hi>foſſilia mineralia,</hi> there is ſure a Mine-work. And where ſuch minerals are, they ſoon diſſolve into a water or <hi>lixivium:</hi> and this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the water and the <hi>lixivium;</hi> water affords only the mineral, and the metals allow the flowers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, out of theſe comes a <hi>lixivium:</hi> the effect of this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:137180:38"/> water and <hi>lixivium</hi> is well known, for they carry in a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den way flowers or tinctures of oars. The cement or <hi>lixivium</hi> at <hi>Schwelnitz</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> corrodeth iron into a <hi>Schlich</hi> or ſliding; and if that iron ſliding is taken again out of the Dray, and is caſt, then is it good mercury. There are more of ſuch <hi>lixiviums,</hi> but men regard them not, that water alſo is a ſign of a very pure mineral; for let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water at <hi>Goſlar,</hi> doth it not yield pure white and red vitriol? and in ſeveral other places there is found good copper, ſilver, and lead: out of theſe waters may be had again minerals, as you pleaſe or intend to have them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great pains-taking. For if a mineral is exſiccated, then it hath no more the ſtrength to run forth, but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth tough, and is dried up ſinking into the ground. There are waters in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſavouring of ſulphur and allom, which afford ſtore of gold and copper; alluminous water in <hi>Miſnia</hi> afford ſilver and copper; the waters in <hi>Bohemia</hi> which taſte of ſaliter or iron, afford ſeveral ſorts of metal, except gold. The Mines in <hi>Styria</hi> have their ſpecial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline waters and <hi>lixiviums,</hi> beſides other excellent Mine-works, inſomuch that the whole Mines are of meer ſteel, copper, gold, ſilver, quickſilver, and other things mens hearts may wiſh for. The ſalt waters at <hi>Franckenhouſe,</hi> do they not ſignifie that there are curious Mine-works there? which if the inhabitants took more notice of, and were more known, what gains could they not make of them? The more theſe waters are running, the better they ſerve for many uſes; if they are ſtanding, it is a ſign that there are evill and bad minerals at hand? and that there are cide, maters, and minerals that were gone and left behinde in abundance, of ſediments and fumes.

                     <p>HE that intends to meddle with rods, muſt not follow after his own fancie, nor bring novelties unto Mine-works out of his ſuppoſitions. For nature indureth not to be curb'd in her order, but men muſt be regulated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature. Concerning the rod, good notice muſt be taken of the Breathing, &amp; this <hi>Lucens virgula,</hi> or fire-rod is ordered upon the operative &amp; attractive breathing; for if it were ſtrong, though it doth not kindle, yet it doth its office, through &amp; by a heat appropriated to its quality. A great heat in a furnace puts out a ſmall heat, light, or fire, the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hath this breathing upon this Rod, which being kindled &amp; ſtuck in, is put out, no upper air or wind can hurt it; for our upper fire cannot live or burn under ground, for if a light or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:137180:40"/> candle be hit againſt a ſtone or earth, it is put out, becauſe it cannot fall in. It attracteth the nutriment, which maketh this Rod burn, and ſucks it dry. This is remarkable in the matter of this Rod, that it hath an unctuoſity which doth not burn, as the ſeeds husk is, whoſe poyſon put out lights under ground in an extraordinary manner. And the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above ground doth the ſame in a peculiar manner. Few miners know this fire, and is the onely means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the inhalation is known. This fire-work, thus extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is of ſpecial uſe in Mines, and then in the After-work is of ſeverall uſe for metals; of the which more in its due place: to deſcry fire by fire is no mean skill, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean fire can in no other way be maſtered. Ancient Philoſophers have written much of it: how ſuperiour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements make their juncture with the nether, intimating al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that by the means of the middle, Elements muſt be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the emergy of the ſuperiour and ſubterranean. For they are ſpirits which joyn the ſouls above with the groſſer bodies below, elſe nothing could have any ſucceſſe wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This we ſhall know at the great day in the other life, where God will ſeparate the burning from the flame, when it flameth; then will the burning conſume Hell, and Hell will ſoon be burned away; neither will there be any clearneſſe, but darkneſs, becauſe God beſtoweth the light upon his choſen ones, which is neither a flame nor a burning; here theſe muſt ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:137180:45"/> For at ſome certain time you ſee the Sun draw water (as the vulgar ſpeech is) ſo the beams have that quality, they comfort metals by ſtricking downward.

The reaſon of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nether breathing of the air is there, and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, draweth this breathing, carrieth it down, and the metal within the rod is pull'd downward, as if it would joyn the ſame with the reſt of that body. Thus the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and halations are copulated; the beam muſt conceive on the earth, in which it is to operate, it bringeth no rain to the earth, but the vapours of the earth which riſe, the ſame make or cauſe the rain, ſnow, and hoar-froſt, bring the ſame to the earth, imbibing the ſame therewith; the ſame operation it hath on the ſubterranean vapours, cauſed by the breathing of the metals within; in their aſcenſion it makes them heavy, ſo that they are able to fall unto <hi>Sol,</hi> helping the ſame in its fertile work.

                     </p>
                     <p>This Rod is appropriated unto planets which hang their bodies to the ſeeds as long as the great breathing of <hi>Sol</hi> holds ſtill, and ſuffers himſelf to be obſcured, and he muſt ſuffer in giving his luſtre to the earth by rain, miſt, and ſnow, ſo long till he breaks thorow them. So the bodies alſo are corruptible in this upper fire more than the lower in their work. Therefore ſuch a rod muſt be applied which I call an upper rod, that the oppoſite breathing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting metalline beams which were received of the Sun, and ſtrengthened again may be returned from the bottome to the <hi>Systeria,</hi> be it as high as it will.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Turco</hi> or Rod is a twiſted tender branch of a Hazel, which from that twiſt on the bulk is hollow three fingers length, for its pith muſt be out of it, and the mercury of metals muſt be put in, the weight of three barley corns or grains: this Rod ſtirreth the halation from below upward, this is the condition of this Rod, whereby is known that that metal is of an infirm body, wanting the influence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the rod is ſtirred, making it rebound; intimating, that it is unfit for his work, and that another body is fitter. The planets with their influence work more on imperfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, than on perfect ones. For the Sun doth not put a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on mercury of the body, but a certain conſtellation doth it, the reſt joyning in the work, and are found next to it, except <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> theſe meddle not with this Rod. Though theſe alſo are planets, and belong to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect breathing, and have their particular rod, as others have theirs, which preſs toward their ſeveral work, they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for not aiming at the works matter, which maketh its principle as the mercury of metals.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be had a ſufficient inſtruction for to know it. It is thus; a metal is known before it caſts any cruſt, and how deep the oar lieth, and how it may be wrought upon, if I would know whether there be a ſufficiency in that oar, the ſame I learn by the leap of this Rod; if it be a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal oar, the Rod leapeth the more, more than the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body of Saturn is. For this Rod doth not ſtirre the body, but that which is the moſt in that body, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the mercury of the body: for it yields good ſtore of it, and may put on eaſily another garment, and be a mercury of metals, and ſo forth.</p>
                     <p>If in that place be Tin and Wiſmuth, the rod applied leapeth not ſo quick, but more ſlowly than it doth where Saturn is: where a copper or iron oar is, there that rod moveth more ſlowly yet: But this muſt be obſerved, that there is no breathing about metals, unleſſe they be under ground; for when they are there, then are they in their works, whither they be increaſing or decreaſing, they cannot be without breathing then. Thus much of theſe Rods.</p>

                     <p>THe Malignant breathing, as it is generally ſo called, is a peſtilent ſalt, which indangereth not only the Miners, but hurts the oars alſo: for it allayeth or maketh the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things fall, which are in the oar, being thereby obſtructed in their natural working. The manner of the ſetling of theſe breathings are worthy to be noted. It may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto an Eclipſe, though the beams which aſcendeth keepeth its courſe, yet the breathing ſtayeth it, and will not let it goe about that place; being in that ſtay and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, its <hi>Ferch</hi> and ſeed parteth; at laſt, through its ſides or walls it ſuffers fluid oars to come in; thence is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of ſuch fluid oars, of which there are ſeverall ſorts. But this is to be noted; That weather is called a weather, becauſe it is not of ſuch clear air, as it is above ground with us, ſtill carrieth ſomething with it, which is groſſer &amp; hurtful unto man more than the air above with us: for men are not commanded to dwell and live under ground, but if any ones imployment lieth that way, he muſt be contented to do ſo, commit his condition to God almighty; becauſe he muſt indure and ſuck in ill fumes, and get Mine-diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>This ſubterranean air growing ponderous, by reaſon of the fume and water-ſtone, which ſtop and corrupt the croſs paſſage, then is it called a Weather-ſalt: this is apparen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THere is a moſt heavy caſe which befalls clefts, paſſages and ſtructures, called water-pools under ground. For it is a truth undeniable, that clefts &amp; paſſages under ground have their waters, both the day-water and the night-water, if once opened, then are they made paſſable, which prove the utter ruine of Mine-works. Therefore my counſell is, not to make paſſages navigable to come to the oars. It is juſt as if one would dig a mans heart out of his body, and he would begin to dig at the pulſe, and ſo along all the way to the heart, would it not be an horrid butchery? There is a neerer path to the well, what needs to make far fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es about. There is a twofold water under ground; the day-water, and the ground-water; the day-water is not hurtful unto the ſtructures, but rather helpful, ſoaking away many things, and takes away many times from the ſtages the ground-water. Let the ground-water be kept out as much as poſſible may be, for it doth hurt, if it cannot paſſe away, neither let it ſpring from below out of its <hi>Catharacts.</hi> Keepe out the fire alſo; for both are hurtful to metals, and to all things in the world, if they play the maſters.</p>

The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Vitriol hath the precedence before all the reſt, which is ſufficiently known in their proves and exemines, as may be demonſtrated to the eye.

                     <p>Obſerve onely this difference, that the Salt muſt be drawn forth from the Mercurial body, as it hapned unto the Soul, with the ſpirit of Mercury; whereas on the other ſide the Salt of Gold muſt not be drawn forth with the ſaturnal water, becauſe it is too weak for the body of Gold, but with a water, which hath been expreſſed in the deſcription of <hi>particulars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſtinction muſt be exactly obſerv'd, being of great concernment, becauſe the Salt of Vitriol is not ſo ſtrongly guarded, and is not in ſo fix'd a body, as the Gold is, but is ſtill an open body, which ſaw no coagulation as yet, nor paſſed it through any melting fire, therefore that body ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came as yet to any compactneſſe, there is room left for its own ſpirit to enter into, can embrace, and unite with its like, and a ſnow white extraction of Salt may be had, whereas on the other ſide a ſharper matter muſt penetrate Gold, as you ſhall hear, when I ſhall ſpeak more of it in its due place.</p>
                     <p>Behold now, my friend, whatſoever thou art, what minde I bare towards thee, and how I am affected unto thee in my heart, the like I never durſt look for from thee.

                     <p>Having thus ſeparated your three Mineral bodies, and ordered them into certain diviſions, and put away the dregs, wherein they lye hid, then look to it, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect none of it, by the diminiſhing of the quantity, which would prove a great fault to your work, and keep each in its own and due quantity, otherwiſe in your work you cannot come to a happy end.</p>
                     <p>This is the thrift which ſo many have miſſed, and have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:137180:86"/> written great volumes about it: for all what cometh from our Philoſophick Gold, and hath divided it ſelf into three parts, the ſame muſt be brought into one, without any loſſe and diminution, which is to enter into a new form again, and become a meliorated ſubſtance, &amp; nothing of it muſt be done away, but onely the <hi>feces terrae</hi> in which the glorious Salt had its dwelling.

For the performing of my promiſe, not leading you into any tedious ſophiſtick labyrinths, but diſcloſing the very head-ſpring of all goodneſſe, you are to note and to take into ſerious conſideration my following expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if ſo be your intent is to learn any thing concerning this Art; I do not purpoſe to uſe any prolixity in words, for that were to no purpoſe: I do love few words, which are full of pith.</p>
                  <p>Note, it is given but to few men to attain unto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of this Art; though many ſtrive, and endeavour to work upon that ſtructure, yet the true knowledge, and the attaining thereunto the great Creator hath made common,

                  <p>My friend, deſpiſe not to read good, and real writings of ſuch men, which had the Philoſophick ſtone before us, for from them I had it, next unto Gods revelation: the reading of their books muſt be frequently iterated, then the fundamentals thereof will the better ſtick to the memory, and truth, like a burning Candle, be not extinguiſht.</p>

                  <p>The great Creator hath given in the Creation to every Creature a ſeed, whereby it ſhould generate and encreaſe, whereby Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually be preſerved.

Note further; Animals are compoſed of fleſh and bloud, there is in them alſo a living ſpirit and breath, which dwelleth in them, but they are deſtitute of a rational Soul, which before them, man is endued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.

                        <p>THe life of earth maketh ſpring up Vegetables, and he that ſaith that the earth is dead, tells an untruth, for a dead thing cannot impart any livelyneſſe to another, and the increaſe is at a ſtay in dead things, becauſe the ſpirit of life is fled: The ſpirit is the life and ſoul of the earth, which dwelleth in her, receiveth its efficacy upon earthly things from heavenly Aſtrals: for all Vegetables, Metals, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals receive their power, increaſe, and nouriſhment from the ſpirit of the earth. For the ſpirit is the life, which is fed by Aſtrals, which further imparts a nouriſhment unto growing things: as the Childe lieth hid in the Mothers Womb, and is fed there by the Mother: ſo the earth feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:137180:119"/> Minerals alſo, which lie hid in her belly by a ſpirit, which ſhe receiveth from above: the earth doth afford no power <hi>per ſe,</hi> but the living ſpirit, which dwelleth in her doth it, and if ſhe ſhould want her ſpirit, then ſhe were dead, and could afford no nouriſhment, becauſe from her Sulphur, or fatneſſe, the ſpirit is taken away, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth living powers, and driveth forth Vegetables, and other growing things by a nutriment.</p>
                        <p>Two contrary ſpirits may dwell together in one ſubject, but are ſtill at variance, as in Gun-powder, which being lighted, theſe two ſpirits fly aſunder, making a great noiſe, fly in the aire, are no more diſcerned, no body can tell whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are gone, or what they had been, if it were not known experimentally, what manner of ſpirits they were, and in what ſubject they dwelled.</p>
                        <p>From hence you may learn, that life is a meer ſpirit, and all theſe things, which the ignorant world counteth to be dead, muſt be brought into an incomprehenſible viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpiritual life, and muſt be preſerved therein, if ſo be that life ſhall work with life, and the ſpirits, which are fed and nouriſhed by a heavenly dew, are born of one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, heavenly, and earthly ſubſtance, which is called <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria informis.</hi>

                        <p>And as there belongeth unto Iron a Magnet, which by reaſon of its own wonderfull inviſible love is of an attractive quality: ſo our Gold hath a Magnet alſo, which Magnet is the <hi>prima materia</hi> of our great ſtone. If you conceive aright of this expreſſion, then you may be bleſſed with riches in this world.</p>
                        <p>One Declaration more I muſt hold forth unto you in this Chapter: Man that looketh into a glaſſe, ſeeth a reflexion of his image, but is not palpable, ſave the glaſſe, the party looked into: ſo from this matter muſt be expell'd a viſible ſpirit, which is incomprehenſible, the ſame ſpirit, I ſay, is the root of the life of our body, and the Mercury of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, out of which the liquid water in our Art is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137180:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> which in its compoſition you muſt make again ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and muſt prepare it by certain means, from the loweſt to the higheſt degree into a tranſcendent Medicine. For our beginning is an up-ſhut comprehenſible body, its middle is a volatile ſpirit, and in the goldiſh water there is no corroſiveneſſe at all, whereby our Philoſophers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd their lives: but the end thereof is a ſuperfix'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for humane, and metalline bodies; this knowledge indeed fitteth Angels better than man: True, men attain unto that knowledge alſo, obtaining the ſame of God by their earneſt prayers, who are thankfull unto him for it, and beneficial to the needy.</p>
                        <p>At the cloſing I tell thee for a certain truth, that one work muſt beget the other: for our matter at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our work muſt in the beſt manner be purified, then opened, broken and deſtroyed, and reduced to duſt and aſhes. All this being done, then make of it a volatile ſpirit, as white as ſnow, and another volatile ſpirit, as red as bloud, theſe two ſpirits contain a third, and yet are but one ſpirit; theſe are the three ſpirits, which preſerve and encreaſe life, joyn theſe together, miniſter to them their natural neceſſary meat and drink, keep them warm in the bed of wedlock to their perfect birth, then you will ſee and finde what the Creator and Nature hath allowed for you to know. And know, that I never made ſo plain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: God hath incorporated more operation and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into Nature, than thouſands may give credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. There is a Seal and Lock ſet before me, to ſay no more, that others alſo may write of marvellous things, which naturally are permitted by the Creator, which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men count to be ſupernatural. For natural things have their firſt beginning from ſupernatural ones, yet both together are found to be meerly natural.</p>

                  <p>The higheſt and chiefeſt <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> which the Lord God hath laid into nature, is the excocted, prepared, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137180:156"/> fixed ſubſtance of our ſtone, before it is fermented. A higher, greater, and more excellent <hi>Univerſal Medicine,</hi> and <hi>aurum potabile</hi> cannot be found nor had in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the whole World; for it is a heavenly Balſam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its firſt principles, and original cometh from heaven, made formal in earth, or under ground, and is afterwards, being exactly prepared, brought into a <hi>plus quam perfection,</hi> of which firſt principle and Nativity of this heavenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have already written ſufficiently, and count it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to be repeated here.</p>
                  <p>Now as this excocted and perfect ſubſtance is the higheſt, chiefeſt, and greateſt <hi>Univerſal Medicine</hi> unto man, even ſo on the other ſide the ſame matter after its <hi>fermentation,</hi> is a Tincture alſo, and the chiefeſt, greateſt, and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Univerſal Medicine</hi> upon all Metals whatſoever, and thereby may be tranſmuted into their higheſt melioration and health, namely into the pureſt Gold. This is the firſt, chiefeſt and greateſt <hi>aurum potabile</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Medicine</hi> of the whole World, of which alone great volumes could be written: whoſe preparation was ſet down circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the third part, needleſſe to be repeated here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; At this preſent I will ſpeak of the true and full <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi> how a true <hi>aurum potabile</hi> is to be had, and prepared from Gold, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt manner is moſt exactly putrified.

The <hi>anima</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> being wholly diſſolved into the <hi>Mercurial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and nothing is ſeen in the bottom, then pour to it twice as much of the beſt rectified ſpirit of wine, brought to its higheſt degree, the glaſſe muſt be luted exactly, digeſt, and putrify gentle for twelve, or fifteen dayes together, then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract <hi>per alembicum,</hi> that matter cometh over in a bloud-red tranſparent colour: this abſtracting muſt be iterated, nothing muſt be left in the bottom, which is corporeal, then you have the true <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> which can never be reduced into a body.</p>
                  <p>But note, the Gold before its deſtruction and extraction of its Soul muſt be purged in the higheſt degree. There is made another <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> &amp; artificially prepared, which though it cannot be ſaid, or ſet down in writing to be the full &amp; true potable Gold, yet is it more than half an <hi>aurum potabile</hi> counted, becauſe it is tranſcending effectual in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes, in which nature might have ſtood in great doubts.

                  <p>Take this extracted Soul of Gold, drawn forth with the ſweet ſpirit of common Salt, edulcorate it moſt purely and exactly, at laſt exiceate it, put it in a ſpacious Viol, or body of glaſſe, pour on it red Oyl of Vitriol, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmed, and rectified <hi>per reto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond way to prepare this half <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> which though it be but half an <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> yet in vertue and efficacy is far preferred before the other now ſpoken of, and is done as followeth:</p>

                  <p>Of this Philoſophick Sulphur pour on it as much, that the <hi>Solar</hi> Soul may be diſſolved, let it ſtand in a gentle Bath, let the diſſolution be made, then pour more of the beſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine to it, digeſt gently, draw theſe over, let nothing ſtay behinde in the bottom, then you have a Medicine, which doth not want above two Grains of the right and true <hi>

Here the knowing Phyſician muſt enquire into the cauſe, from which of theſe three the Symptome doth ariſe, and cure the ſame with convenient remedies, and not with any contrary Medicines: as heat muſt be cured with heat, cold with cold, pricking with pricking: for one heat draweth the other, one cold draweth another, even as Iron is drawn by a Magnet; and ſo pricking ſimples may cure ſtiching diſeaſes, and poyſonous Minerals can heal, and bring to right poyſonous Symptomes, if they be duely and well prepared. And although ſometimes externally a cooler be ſupplied, however I ſpeak as a Philoſopher, and one that is experienced in nature, that like muſt be cured and expelled fundamentally with the like, otherwiſe true Medicaments are not applied, and the Phyſicians deal not really in their profeſſion.

                     <p>Here I ſpeak of ſuch diſeaſes, which by ſome are called incurable: for ordinary diſeaſes there are ordinary means, which here are not mentioned, the uſes of them are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a ſpecial Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>But of my PHALAIA I ſay thus much, according to my long experience, that nothing can conceal, or hide it ſelf from her, being a penetrating ſearcher into all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſhe penetrateth the body ſpiritually like a fume, penetrateth the Arteries, Muſcles, and all the parts of the body like a Balſam, reſtoreth ſtrength which was loſt by her Salt ſpirit. Further, I cannot ſpeak in the praiſing of my PHALAIA, ſhe being a praiſe to ſuch that make uſe of her. He that getteth this PHALAIA tightly, to him is ſhe ſufficient for to cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. No tongue is able to expreſſe, and ſet forth fully her vertues.</p>
                     <p>As diſeaſes do differ, which are incident unto the body, ſo there are means for their cure: but this Medicine cureth all diſeaſes in general, being of an heavenly fidereal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, deſcended from the Elements, and generated by the three principles, coming from the very heart of its Center of the whole circumference of the Globe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, affording to <hi>Microcoſme</hi> a perfect Medicine found ſo really, according as the name imports her vertue, but if rightly made and prepared, the uſe of it will prove it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
                     <p>ASA is found in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> operation, for external Symptoms, as old Ulcers, Fiſtulaes, Cancers, which made many Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians doubt whether ever they may be cured; but this ASA hath made the cure: it conſumeth all bad bloud, which was fall'n into corruption, and may be inwardly uſed, becauſe it will then exiccate, and dry up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, from whence ſpring all manner of Sores, Fiſtulaes, Cancers, Wolves, <hi>noli me tangere,</hi> running Legs, Worms, and the like, be it on what part of the body, where Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Pulteſſes, and the like cannot help, and are not ſtrong enough, this alone will do it. For freſh wounds,

Symptomes in wounds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their cauſes from within, muſt be cured by ſearching into them, and the means for their cure muſt be prepared of that ſtrength, that they may reach home. As in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, things muſt be united, and be taken from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ABIHAIL, being joyned in their principles of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For ordinary wounds there is no need of it, if no Symptomes are at hand, and the party endangered, a Balſam onely will perform the deed, molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the fleſh, and nature will further, and promote the cure</p>
                     <p>Be thankfull next God to me, that hath taught you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Medicines, and are ſuch, which others before me have concealed, they can cure fundamentally any Symptomes, be they within, or without on the body, ſuch vertues are not found in Out-landiſh woods, drugs, or herbs: Forrainers have their proper climates, under which they have convenient Phyſical Vegetables: our climate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords unto us proper Medicinal Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals for our conſtitution; onely Doctors are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert to make their Medicinal preparations out of them. I hold with my Phyſick PHALAIA and ASA of one name in their deſcent, whereby nature hath made me to be a Phyſician; it keepeth good to the laſt, preſerveth man in health and ſtrength all the time the Creator hath appointed for him: vertue it hath ſhewed triumphantly in many parties, obtaining victory againſt all its enemies, and it was apparent to the world, that theſe two Medicines PHALAIA and ASA of one kinde, and of one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made and prepared: and it is found dayly, that in the generality they can ſet all into a perfect degree, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137180:168"/> from the Center, can preſerve the Center as the Root, and can bring things to right within and without, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that end, for which it is prepared.</p>
                     <p>Thus I wiſh the Reader, to whom I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ithfully intimate the Manuals of it, proſperity and ſucceſſe in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that it may be unto his health: the work will praiſe the Maſter, upon Oath I further inform you t us, that four things are required to make a perfect Philoſopher and true Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he muſt be importunate and fervent in his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, as the higheſt heavenly Phyſician, to aſk of him grace, wiſdom, underſtanding, and his bleſſing upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, that it may appear unto the world, that God grants things for the good of men, that he may be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aiſed and magnified for ſuch benefits: and is to ſhew himſelf in his life and converſation godly and honeſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Phyſician ought to know the diſeaſes, and to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, and what proper remedies he is to uſe againſt theſe diſeaſes: for without the knowledge of diſeaſes a Phyſician is not perfect: mans complexion muſt be diſcerned, the cauſe of the diſeaſe ſearch'd into, and the means well conſidered, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries be applied, whereby further troubles are cauſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proper remedies fitting the diſeaſe muſt be applied, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be made unto former health.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is requiſite, that he read frequently the writings of ancient Philoſophers, and read them over and over, and take notice in what they do concurre and agree, and where they aim all at one mark, then he that hath underſtanding will diſcern the good from the bad, Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry from truth: the ancients knew many good things, for mine own part I muſt confeſſe, that I borrowed the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my knowledge from them, which made me to lay it to heart, and am thereby moved to leave for others alſo a corner-ſtone, that truth may further be confirmed, and the grounds of it be made eaſier, clearer, plainer, and more manifeſt by a further knowledge of my writing.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:137180:168"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, a Philoſopher muſt learn to Anatomize things in nature, to know what they contain within and without, to ſeparate the poyſon from the Medicinal quality. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belong ſeveral Manuals, how to diſſolve, ſeparate, exalt, and prepare fully Metals, Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals.

No ſuch matter. Thus you ſee, that Gods bleſſing muſt be obtained by fervent and frequent praying unto God, the cauſes of diſeaſes muſt be known, their cure muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the direction of Philoſophick writings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>heſe four things may glory in his wayes, confirming things in deeds, and not to exerciſe a trade upon other mens receipts. My Medicaments, if well prepared and duely uſed, will by Gods help make known, that they received their ſtrength from God, the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Creator to perform theſe things, which ignorants, and men of li tle faith cannot comprehend: by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence faith getteth ſtrength, that man may praiſe the higheſt, who hath put ſuch ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137180:170"/> not prate of things onely without experimental knowledge, diſputing of colours with the blinde man; learn to know the ground with your own eyes and hands, which Nature hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth within her, then you may ſpeak wiſely of them with good reaſon, and you may build upon an invincible Rock. If you do not ſo, then you are but a Phantaſtick prater, whoſe diſcourſe is grounded on ſand without experience, and is ſoon ſhaken by every winde, and ruined in the end. The ground of this knowledge muſt be learned as you heard, by anatomizing and ſeparating of things, which by diſtillation is made known: where every Element is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated apart, there it will be made known what is cold, or moiſt, warm, or dry. There you learn to know the three principles, how the ſpirit is ſeparated from the body, and how the Oyl is ſeparated from the water, and how the Sale is drawn from the <hi>Caput mort</hi> of each matter, and is reduced again into a ſpirit, and how theſe three are afterward joyn'd again, and by fire are brought into one body. Further is here learn'd, how each after its ſeparation, and afterward in a conjunction may profitably and ſafely be uſed for their ſeveral uſes they are prepared for: all which muſt be done by a <hi>medium.</hi> At the firſt Creation man is earthy &amp; groſſe, but his Soul, Spirit, and Body, being ſeparated by death, putrifieth under ground, and when the Higheſt cometh to judgement, he is raiſed again, his Body, Soul, and ſpirit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth together, according to Faith and Scripture; that body is no more earthy, as it was formerly, but is found heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clarified, glittering as the Stars in the Eaſt, and like the Sun is ſeen, when all the Clouds are paſt. So it is here, when earthineſſe is broken, divided, and ſeparated, then the three principles of the dead ſubſtance are made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the dead one is forſaken, the living power comes to her perfection, becauſe her obſtruction is laid aſide, that the vertue in the operation may be manifeſted; In this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and manifeſtation is then known what theſe three principles are, which are ſo much diſcourſed of, namely Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, according to the condition of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:137180:170"/> the ſubject. He that doth not think it to be true, let him go to the end of the World, where he ſhall feel all what in his dumb capacity he could not comprehend: if any one ſhould intend to teach me any other with a prolixity of words, he may fill me with words, but he muſt prove it really alſo, for without that I am not bound to believe his words, but deſire ſome ſign as <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the Twelve, who look'd for an Ocular demonſtration: I might have left out <hi>Thomas,</hi> but being there is a clift between a ſpiritual and worldly unbeliever, I gave liberty to my minde to ſpeak it, for there is a great difference in heavenly and worldly matters, touching faith and things comprehenſible, and there is that difference found alſo in fidereal &amp; earthly things: for fidereal things are comprehended by ſharp ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Arithmatick rules, but to the finding out of earthly things there belongeth ſpeculation and ſeparation: with ſpeculation muſt be joyned an intention, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is annexed to ſpeculation, the former is done ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, becauſe the ſpirit of man doth not reſt, deſireth to apprehend more qualities of the ſpirit in things natural: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpirit ſtil draweth its like: the reſt is earthy: for an earthy body ſeparateth by manuals the earthly body from the ſpiritual part, and ſo the one may be diſcerned before and from the other.

                     <p>So it is with man, for one man alone cannot produce a new birth, unleſs both ſeeds of male and female be united, for after this conjunction through the Nutriment of the body, and continued naturall heat of theſe two ſeeds, which in the Center are known for one Nature, get a new life, and more men are begotten, which propagate further by their ſeed, by this means the whole world is fill'd with men. This ſeed of man is the nobleſt ſubtileſt blood of a white quality, in which dwelleth the vital Spirit, which is driven together by motion. If theſe ſeeds of both kindes by their deſire of luſt are together united, and their Natures be not corrupted, or elſe are contrary one to another, then there is preſerved a life by a heat, and brought to perfection in the mothers womb, and another man is brought forth, Thus much be ſpoken of the ſeed of Animals.</p>
                     <p>The vegetable ſeed is made palpable and viſible which from each kinde of herb is ſeparated and propagated in the earth for an increaſe, which ſeed muſt firſt putrifie in the earth, and then muſt be nouriſhed by a temperate moiſture, at laſt this ſeed by a convenient warm air is brought to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, thus vegetables are increaſed, and in their kinde preſerved: but the firſt beginning of a vegetable ſeed is a ſpirituall eſſence or aſtral influence, whereby in the earth was gotten an imagination, and became impregnated with a matter, out of which by the help of the Elements it came to be ſomething: what form of ſeed the earth was deſirous of after the heavenly impreſſion, that form it received firſt, and brought it to a kinde, which bringeth a further increaſe by its palpable ſeed in the generation, hereby man may try his futher ſkill: but he is not able to create a new ſeed, as Nature
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137180:172"/> doth by an influence from above onely he is able to increaſe a formed ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Of Metals and Minerals I inform you this, that there is one onely Almighty Being, which is from eternity, and abideth unto eternity, which is the Creator of heaven and earth, namely the eternal Deity in three diſtinct perſons, which three in the Deity are a perfect divine being: and though I confeſs and acknowledge theſe three perſons, yet I confeſs onely one God in one Being. This I do now ſpeak as a Type of the firſt ſeed of the three principles, that the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to beget Metallin ſeeds is wrought in the earth by a fideriall impreſſion, which quality preſſeth from above into the neather as in the belly of the earth, and worketh conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually a heat therein, with the help of the Elements; for both muſt be together: the earthy affords an imagination, that the earth is fitted for conception and is impregnated, the Elements nouriſh and feed this fruit, bring it on by a continued hot quality unto perfection, the earthy ſubſtance affords a form thereunto; thus at the beginning the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin and Mineral ſeed is effected namely by an aſtral imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Elemental operation, and terreſtriall form: the aſtral is heavenly, the Elementary is ſpiritual, and the earthy is corporeall, theſe three make of their firſt Center the firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Metallin ſeed, which Philoſophers have further ſearched into, that out of this eſſence there is become a form of a Metallin matter, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For Metals may be deſtroyed and eaſily reduced unto Minerals, and of Minerals are prepared Medicaments, which ripen and tranſmute Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which muſt be noted; and it is done, when Spirit,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:137180:172"/> Soul and Body are ſeparated &amp; purely reunited. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terreſtrity being put off, then followeth a perfect birth, and the perfect ripening by heat performs her office, that Spirit, Soul and Body at the beginning in their firſt ſeed have been a heavenly water, which begot theſe three, out of which three is become a Metalline Sulphur, a Metalline Mercury, &amp; a Metalline ſalt, theſe in their conjunction made a fix, viſible, palpable body; firſt began a Mineral one, then a Metalline by an aſtral imagination, digeſted and ripened by the Elements, and by an earthly ſubſtance are made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Material.</p>
